2.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Description:
a.HTTP1.1 is started in 1997 which is a older version while HTTP2 started in 2015 which is more advanced than HTTP1.1
b.HTTP1.1 is slower compared to HTTP2 in terms of getting requests like HTTP1.1 gets only 6 requests while HTTP2 gets multiple requests after a secure TCP connection is established
c.TCP connections established between client and server in HTTP1.1 are limited 
d.In HTTP2 single secure TCP connection is used after which the requests sent are in hundreds 
e.HTTP2 is used for faster connection but we may not sure the security is more in this.
f.HTTP1.1 is a bit slower but secure because it establishes TCP connections rapidly through hand shakes
g.HTTP1.1 is still used for secure email,banking transactions.... 
h.HTTP2 is used for faster requesting like video streaming, gaming....
i.Features like CORS,KEEP ALIVE are present in HTTP1.1,KEEP ALIVE option helps in reusing same TCP connection for multiple HTTP requests 


3.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript 

Description:
An object is a entity with properties 
In javascript object has properties which can be shown by key value pair assosiation
For example a car is an object with different properties like model,colour,engine type,fuel used.
This is the way object can have properties which define the characteristics of object

the representation of an object is as follows

let objectName={key1:value1, key2:value2}

for example:    const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
we can call the property by using objectName.propertyname like 
car.type gives the "Fiat" and car.model gives "500"
